\rhead{Page \thepage\ of \pageref{LastPage}}

This homework is due on Blackboard Learn by 8:00am on 20 March 2014. There will be a total of 10 points available. 

Provide a one-page writeup of your proposed end-of-the-semester project. The goal of this homework is to make sure you are on the right track and have a managable project. I expect that most of you will perform a Bayesian analysis of some data. The writeup should then include

\begin{itemize}
\item a description of your data and
\item the model that you propose to fit.
\end{itemize}

More theoretical projects are certainly welcome.

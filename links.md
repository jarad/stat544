{% include JB/setup %}

On this page I hope to link to anything that will be relevant for STAT 544 split into categories: Course related, RSS feeds, R and packages, and Bayesian software.

### Course related
- [Course](http://jarad.github.com/stat544)
- [Book](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/)
- [Videos](http://www.youtube.com/jaradniemi)
- [Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=30avg04h5laphv9qoidr80cibs%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Chicago)

### RSS feeds
- [Course posts](http://jarad.github.com/stat544/atom.xml)
- [Course comments](http://stat544.disqus.com/latest.rss)

### R (the statistical software environment)
- [R](http://www.r-project.org/)
- [My short course](http://niemiconsulting.com/blog/includes/class/IntroR.zip)
- [Bayesian packages](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html)

###Bayesian software

The main purpose of this section are links to non-R software that allow you to perform Bayesian inference. But often these software have an R interface and are given below the software themselves. In addition, some of the R interfaces can be used for multiple software options, but (for brevity) I have only listed them here once.

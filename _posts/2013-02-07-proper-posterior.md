The video shows an example where an improper prior could lead to an improper posterior, namely in a binomial model with a Be(0,0) prior and the data are all failures or all successes. In addition, it shows proofs that say 
- if the prior is proper and the data is discrete, then the posterior is proper. 
- if the prior is proper and the data is continuous, then the posterior is almost always proper.
And, I don't know of an example where the posterior is improper when using a proper prior and the data being continuous.

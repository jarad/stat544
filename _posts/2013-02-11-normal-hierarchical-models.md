This video discusses normal hierarchical models with a known observation variance. 
Through a simulation study, it shows that when the group means are all the same there is a lot of shrinkage toward the overall grand mean while when the group means are quite distinct very little shrinkage is observed.
In addition, the video shows an approach to computation via a decomposition of the posterior distribution into conditional and marginal distributions.

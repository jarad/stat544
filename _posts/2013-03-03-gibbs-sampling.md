This video introduces Gibbs sampling. Gibbs sampling is a method for drawing from a complicated joint distribution by iteratively sampling from the full conditional distributions of that joint distribution. It is the basis for Bayesian inference and, in particular, for the software packages WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, JAGS, Stan, and Proc MCMC.

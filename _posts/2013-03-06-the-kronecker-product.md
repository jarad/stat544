Many people are aware of `%*%` in R for matrix multiplication, but the [Kronecker product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product) `%x%` is less known. It is useful to construct some special matrices. For example, a block-diagonal matrix with $\mathbf{1}_{n \times 1}$ on the diagonal like this (3 groups, 5 observatiosn in each group):

{% highlight text %}
      [,1] [,2] [,3]
 [1,]    1    0    0
 [2,]    1    0    0
 [3,]    1    0    0
 [4,]    1    0    0
 [5,]    1    0    0
 [6,]    0    1    0
 [7,]    0    1    0
 [8,]    0    1    0
 [9,]    0    1    0
[10,]    0    1    0
[11,]    0    0    1
[12,]    0    0    1
[13,]    0    0    1
[14,]    0    0    1
[15,]    0    0    1
{% endhighlight %}

This is essentially the Kronecker product $$I_{3 \times 3} \otimes \mathbf{1}_{5\times 1}$$, and can be generated by:

{% highlight r %}
diag(1, 3) %x% matrix(1, 5, 1)
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, `diag(1, 3)` is an identity matrix, and `matrix(1, 5, 1)` is a $5 \times 1$ matrix.

Schedule
========

As currently taught, this course consists of 15 weeks and 2 classes per week with each class 1:20 long. For planning purposes, I will split each class period into five 15 minute segments with 5 minutes left over for flexibility. Typically I will use the first, third, and fifth for lectures and reserve the 2nd and 4th for an activity to demonstrate what we are working on. The schedule below is for organizing these class periods.
